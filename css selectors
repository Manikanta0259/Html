 <p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</p> 
 </div> 
 <p id="unique">A legendary figure in the world of cricket. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, 
India, Dhoni is celebrated for his exceptional skills as a wicket-keeper, batsman, and captain. He is 
often referred to by his nicknames "Mahi," "Thala," and "Captain Cool" due to his calm demeanor 
under pressure.</p> 
 <p class="highlight">Dhoni's cricketing journey began with his debut for the Indian cricket team 
in 2004. He quickly rose to prominence and became the captain of the Indian team in limited-overs 
formats in 2007 and in Test cricket in 2008. Under his leadership, India achieved remarkable 
success, including winning the ICC T20 World Cup in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, 
and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. 
 In addition to his international success, Dhoni has been a key player in the Indian Premier 
League (IPL), leading the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) to multiple titles. He is known for his 
strategic acumen, finishing abilities, and remarkable consistency. 
 
 Dhoni retired from international cricket in 2019 but continues to play in the IPL. His 
contributions to Indian cricket have earned him numerous accolades, including the Padma Bhushan, 
Padma Shri, and Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award.</p>
